# feature_selection
It includes my learning and useful information related to feature selection in machine learning.
## Different Types of Feature Selection Methods:

        1. Filter Methods
            • Variance 
            • Correlation 
            • Univariate Selection 

        2. Wrapper Methods 
            • Forward Selection 
            • Backward Selection 
            • Exhaustive Search 

        3. Embedded Methods
            • Lasso 
            • Tree Importance

 ## Embedded Methods 

#### Linear Regression:


> ##### Points to remember while using *Linear Regression* for feature selection.
>
> - The magnitude of the coefficients is directly influenced by the scale of the features.
> - *Linear Regression* model assumptions need to be met inorder to make fair comparison of the features by only using their regression coefficients.
> - In addition these coefficients may be penalised by regularisation,therefore being smaller than if we were to compare only that individual feature with the target.
> - **It is not a good choise for feature Selection.**
